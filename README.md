# Project
In this project I have created 4 screens Login,Register,Home and Profile

In Home screen created a Scrolling View Listing all the items,
used Flatlist Component to create the list of items and added the activity indicator also.

Used Stack navigation to navigate to differeny screens and Bottom Tab Navigator to create two tabs at the bottom in the Home screen.
Fetched the Images from API so that the images alongwith the names of the items are visible on the screen, added a button using Button component and using onPress prop ,when the button is clicked it takes to profile screen
